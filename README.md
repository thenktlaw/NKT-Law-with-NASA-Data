## Overview

The **NKTg Law** introduces a novel model for understanding motion based on how an object's **position** (`x`), **velocity** (`v`), and **mass** (`m`) interact. Rather than relying solely on force or energy, this law emphasizes **movement tendencies** caused by these dynamic relationships.

**General form:**

NKTg = f(x, v, m)


Where:

- `x`: Position or displacement relative to a reference point  
- `v`: Velocity  
- `m`: Mass

## Core Quantities

Two key derived quantities define the NKTg Law:

NKTg‚ÇÅ = x √ó p
NKTg‚ÇÇ = (dm/dt) √ó p

Where:

- `p` is the linear momentum: `p = m √ó v`
- `dm/dt` is the rate of change of mass over time
- `NKTg‚ÇÅ` represents position‚Äìmomentum interaction
- `NKTg‚ÇÇ` represents mass-variation‚Äìmomentum interaction

**Unit:** `NKTm` (a unit of varying inertia)

## Interpretation of Movement Tendencies

- If `NKTg‚ÇÅ > 0`: the object tends to **move away** from the stable state.
- If `NKTg‚ÇÅ < 0`: the object tends to **return toward** the stable state.
- If `NKTg‚ÇÇ > 0`: mass variation has a **supporting effect** on movement.
- If `NKTg‚ÇÇ < 0`: mass variation has a **resisting effect** on movement.

## Definition of Stable State

The **stable state** in the NKTg Law is the condition in which `x`, `v`, and `m` interact to maintain the object‚Äôs motion pattern. This balance allows the system to avoid disorder or loss of control.

---

## Applications

This law is especially useful for analyzing motion in systems where:

- Mass is variable (e.g., rockets, stellar objects)
- Traditional mechanics struggles with dynamic inertia

The NKTg Law has been **experimentally validated** using **NASA planetary data (2022‚Äì2024)**. Results and comparisons are available in this repository.
